# Welcome

This is the documentation for TruthUI

You are welcome here

## Philosophy

Truth is in accordance with reality, fact, or actuality.

We don't really know what the final truth is, from flat to round earth, from laws of gravity to laws of relativity.

To be able to find the truth, we need to be able to question everything, think freely.

TruthUI follows the principles of any truth finders.

### Transparency

To find the truth, we need all the information possible.

Components will be as transparent as possible, no hidden logic, no libraries that hide what needs to be done.
Components will have no dependencies if possible, and in case is needed, they will have a clear dependency graph with only one deepness level.

### Simplicity

The truth is always simple.

Components will be as simple as possible, no unnecessary logic, no unnecessary abstractions.
Components will use the closest to vanilla Javascript (while using Typescript), pure css, and pure html (with the framework restrictions). No JSX allowed.

### Solid over adaptable

Truth has a solid foundation in reality.

Components will not try to be 'one size fits all', but will be
solid and reliable in their basic version, allowing you to find
your own way to adapt them to your needs, but feeling safe that
the core is solid.

### Freedom to stay, freedom to leave

Truth doesn't need to be forced. Truth is.

The library will be easy to use as a whole, easy to use components Ã  la carte, and easy to replace with your own components.
Given that components have all the characteristics declared above, you will be able to easily port these to other frameworks if you will.
And the maintainers will have that ability also, in case there is another framework that can offer the features we need.
