# Dialog

The dialog component displays self-contained tasks in a focused window that overlays the page content.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Base} />
<Controls />

## When to use it

Generally, use the dialog component sparingly. Consider displaying more complex tasks and large amounts of information on a separate page instead.

## Usage in code

### Same component or same page

To show a dialog you just need to connect the Dialog with the opener.

The opener is usually a button and it's around the same svelte file as the Dialog.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Opener} />

### Different components or different pages

If the opener and the dialog are in different components or pages, you can use the context API to connect them.

We DON'T recommend using the context API as it is not needed. Our Dialog uses native html dialog element,
it will show in browser as expected without any need to define it in a parent component.

```sveltehtml
<script lang="ts">
	import { getContext, setContext } from 'svelte';

	let dialogContext: HTMLDialogElement;

	type DialogContext = {
		show: () => void;
		close: () => void;
	};

	setContext('dialog', {
		show: () => {
			dialogContext.showModal();
		},
		close: () => {
			dialogContext.close();
		}
	});

	let ctx: DialogContext = getContext('dialog');
</script>
```

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Context} />
