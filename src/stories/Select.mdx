# Select

A select dropdown is a form field that allows users to choose one of the multiple options from a menu.
An example being the expiration date for a users credit card.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Base} />
<Controls />

## When to use it

Best used when there are 4 or more defined options to choose from (e.g. Months).If there are less than 4 options,
consider using the radio button component.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** clearly label the select dropdown so that the user knows what options will be available
- **Do** always provide a default option, typically the placeholder. The default option is not
  selectable but should specify what options will be available.
- **Do** list the options in a logical order. (e.g. Alphabetical, numerical, or in some order that allows the
  user to find the option as easy as possible)
- **Do not** use it to save space or tidy up a form.
- **Do not** use it as a way to filter content

## Prefix

The prefix is an optional element that can be added to the select dropdown. It is used to provide additional context
to the user about the options available. An example of this would be a currency symbol or a country code.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Prefix} />
