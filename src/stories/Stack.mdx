# Stack

The Stack component is used to have a utility that replaces the need for flex with nice defaults of the design library.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Base} />
<Controls />

## Accessibility

The Stack component is a layout utility that doesn't directly impact accessibility. However, its use can indirectly affect the visual and structural organization of content, which has accessibility implications.

### Best practices

Use Stack to improve the visual organization of content for developers.

Overusing Stack components can lead to excessive whitespace and potentially disorienting layouts
especially on smaller screens. Use Stacks judiciously and consider responsive design principles.

## Usage Guidelines

The Stack component has gapping in different sizes. Choose the appropriate size based on the desired visual separation between elements.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.AllSizes} />
