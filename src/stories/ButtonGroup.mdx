# ButtonGroup

The ButtonGroup component groups and formats two buttons. It adds spacing between buttons and handles responsiveness.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Base} />
<Controls />

## Component variations

By default, buttons passed to the ButtonGroup will be centered. Use the `align` prop to align the buttons to the left or to the right on wide viewports. This has no effect on narrow viewports.

<Canvas of={Stories.Alignment} />

## Accessibility

All accessibility considerations for the [`Button` component](Components/Button) also apply to the `ButtonGroup`.
