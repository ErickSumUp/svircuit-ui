# Modal

The modal component displays self-contained tasks in a focused window that overlays the page content.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Base} />
<Controls />

## When to use it

Generally, use the modal component sparingly. Consider displaying more complex tasks and large amounts of information on a separate page instead.

## Usage in code

To show a modal you just need to connect the Modal with the opener. The opener is usually a button.
