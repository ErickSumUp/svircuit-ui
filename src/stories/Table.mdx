# Table

Tables allow users to see detailed information in an organized and orderly way, especially when a task revolves around comparing or analyzing the information set.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Base} />
<Controls />

## When to use it

To present data sets, such as "subaccounts" or "orders". Tables help users find information that they are looking for faster and if the data can be manipulated it can also be used for analysis.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** allow filtering and ordering, if possible, to help our users assess the information faster
- **Do** pair the table component with pagination if your data set has more than 24 items
- **Do** provide a unique identifier for each item and place it as the first column from left to right
- **Do not** make an item on the table actionable. If you need this functionality, consider using a listview.

## Content guidelines

- **Do** align the text or values within columns to left
- **Do** provide simple and short headers for each column
- **Do** use sentence case for headers
- **Do not** include units of measurement on the data item, you should place it just on the header

## Condensed

Sometimes you want to use the Table a little more condensed. Use the **condensed** property available in rows and headers.
Keep it consistent across rows and headers to make it look good.
