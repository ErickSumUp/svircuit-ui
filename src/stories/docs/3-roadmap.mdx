# Roadmap

## v1.0

We require a version that can be seamlessly and safely integrated into backoffices.

- [ ] Prepare a documentation that can be used by developers to integrate Svircuit into their projects.
- [ ] Create tests that can help detect errors in components when they can break the design implementation.
- [ ] Integrate dark mode (a.k.a. B&W theme in Circuit) into Svircuit.

## Desired features but not needed for v1.0

- [ ] Integrate extra color and style modifications themes (Take [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) as example)
- [ ] Integrate automated deployments to npm.
