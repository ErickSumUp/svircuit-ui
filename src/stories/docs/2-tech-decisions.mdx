# Tech definitions

We have taken many lessons from the React's Circuit UI implementation and applied them in Svelte, but we have also taken important design decisions that take the development afar from the React implementation, therefore this is NOT a port in Svelte.

The contributions are highly encouraged and required in all community projects, but **we can't expect contributions if the code is hard to understand**, has many dependencies between components, and have a lot of dependencies on external libraries.

Svelte gives us the power to create single file components, with just enough sugar over plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
This means that the needed knowledge to contribute to Svircuit is **standard for the web**, and requires to learn only Svelte specific things.

## Guidelines:

- Improve on data-heavy components usage like tables.
- Use style guidelines of CircuitUI design system. i.e. color tokens, B&W colors and new buttons.
- Follow T.R.U.T.H Principles

## T.R.U.T.H Principles

- **T**ransparent: Our work speaks for itself, we don't hide complexity, we embrace it and show it. We expect people to review and contribute.
- **R**epeat yourself please. We don't prioritize DRY code over easy to understand code. Unneeded abstractions are discouraged. When it makes sense, we repeat the code.
- **U**ser-centric: Accessibility is a memory and knowledge issue. Accessibility properties are enforced on components when possible.
- **T**empered: We don't want to overengineer the solution, neither do we want to cover every possible use case there is out there. Solve the problems that are in front of us, not the ones that might never come.
- **H**TML semantic: Components are made as little more than HTML wrappers, properties that exist in html will be redirected, reducing the component code size. We respect web standards.

## How these principles affect our development?

### Standard

#### We create Single File Components.

Other than svelte:

- We use plain css.
- We use HTML without libraries.
- We use JS without libraries.

### Components and stories

- Components DON'T depend on any other component, they are standalone. Components may receive snippets, but specific dependencies not enforced.
- Stories are the place where components are used together because it makes sense. Example: Navigation components, Complex Table components, Pagination, etc.
