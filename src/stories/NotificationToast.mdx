# NotificationToast

NotificationToast provides a way for users to visualize bulks of information distributed over multiple pages, while always providing an anchor to move from where they currently are in the list.

<Canvas withToolbar={true} of={Stories.Base} />
<Controls />

## When to use it

Use it when you have a list of more than 25 items related to the same category. This allows a better experience searching through the data for our users.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always place the NotificationToast component on the bottom of the list
- **Do not** use NotificationToast if a list is below 25 items

### Many pages

When there are more than 7 pages in total, the NotificationToast is displayed with spaces in between.

<Canvas of={Stories.Variants} />
